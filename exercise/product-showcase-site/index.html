                        For thirteen years, nineteen-year-old Remy has known 
                        she is possibly the last red witch alive, and she is 
                        determined to stay that way. But the Northern Court 
                        King, who has slaughtered her family and placed a 
                        bounty on red witch heads, is intent on destroying her 
                        kind once and for all. When four fae warriors enter her 
                        tavern refuge, Remy tries to flee, but her magic isn't 
                        strong enough to stop the determined and handsome 
                        Prince Hale of the Eastern Kingdom.

                        Once upon a time Orla was: a woman, a painter, a 
                        lover. Now she is a mother and a wife, and when her 
                        husband Nick suggests that their city apartment has 
                        grown too small for their lives, she agrees, in part 
                        because she does agree, and in part because she is too 
                        tired to think about what she really does want. She 
                        agrees again when Nick announces with pride that he 
                        has found an antiquated Georgian house on the Dorset 
                        cliffsâ€”a good house for children, he says, tons of 
                        space and gorgeous grounds.
