            imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
            language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
            customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic 
            design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
            manifestation.

            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, 
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be 
            applied in the

            <sup>[9][10]</sup>
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only 
            associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is 
            incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge 
            range of types and classes where it can be applied.

         Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the 
         demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly 
         because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay 
         attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who 
         develop them.

            ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic 
            design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas,
             expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human

            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively

            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.
            <sup>[18]</sup> 
            Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
            history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to 
            manuscripts from ancient

        As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, 
        advances in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, 
        with composers or typographers often designing pages according to 
        established type.
        <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
            profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
            specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
            technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
            Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation
            of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from 
            its actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early
            20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and 
            magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of 
            communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, creating
            an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, typographer
            William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to identify the 
            emerging field.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers 
            continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial 
            possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, and 
            graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, 
            book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, 
            signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, 
            and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become 
            a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread 
            worldwide.

        <p>Main article: History of printing</p>
        <p>
            In China, during the Tang dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to
            print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist 
            scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. 
            Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books 
            were produced using movable type printing, making books widely 
            available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).

            In the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg 
            developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace 
            using movable type made with a new metal alloy
            <sup>[20]</sup>
            that created a revolution in the dissemination of information.

            In 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in 
            Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his 
            Journal of Design and Manufactures. He organized the Great Exhibition as a 
            celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

            From 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader in 
            graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, 
            creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style,
            <sup>[22]</sup> 
            in addition to wallpaper and textile designs.
            <sup>[23]</sup> 
            Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, 
            directly influenced Art Nouveau.

            In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the 
            California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled 
            "Graphic Design and Lettering".
            <sup>[26]</sup> 
            Raffe's Graphic Design, published in 1927, was the first book to 
            use "Graphic Design" in its title.

            In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book 
            titled "Graphic Design" and it is known to be the first piece of 
            literature to cover the topic extensively.

            The signage in the London Underground is a classic design example
            <sup>[29]</sup> 
            of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic training, Frank 
            Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The 
            first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a 
            design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the 
            name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif 
            letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of Edward 
            Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston 
            redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on 
            the blue bar in the center of a red circle.

            In the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual 
            production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw 
            individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus 
            moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They 
            designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, 
            furniture, logos, menus, etc.

            Jan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 
            1928 book, New Typography.
            <sup>[32]</sup> 
            He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as 
            fascistic, but it remained influential.[citation needed] 
            Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László 
            Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. 
            They pioneered production techniques[citation needed] and 
            stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The 
            following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain 
            widespread acceptance and application.

            The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with 
            consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from 
            within the graphic design community with the First Things First
             manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was 
             re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in 
             the magazine Emigre 51
             <sup>[34]</sup> 
             stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more 
             useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication – a 
             mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration 
             and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is 
             shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it 
             must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, 
             through the visual languages and resources of design."

            Graphic design can have many applications, from road signs to 
            technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in 
            branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, 
            colors, packaging, labelling and text.

            From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of 
            opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful 
            compositions of visual information – known as information design. 
            With the advent of the web, information designers with experience 
            in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the 
            background to news stories. Information design can include Data 
            and information visualization, which involves using programs to 
            interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation,
            and can be tied in with information graphics.

            messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode
            and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message 
            as a construction of signs which through interaction with 
            receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.
