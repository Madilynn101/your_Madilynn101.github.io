            imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what 
            language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
            customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic 
            design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic 
            manifestation.

            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of 
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, 
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be 
            applied in the

            <sup>[9][10]</sup>
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only 
            associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is 
            incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge 
            range of types and classes where it can be applied.

            Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, 
            the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, 
            particularly because of the development of new technologies and 
            the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence 
            of the engineers who develop them.

            (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of the 
            Labor Unions of SanFrancisco, in an article about technical

            in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising,
            art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many 
            elements, theories, principles, practices,

            and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the 
            ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic 
            design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas,
            expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human 
            experience."

            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. 
            Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design
            emerged, some date it back to the

            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic 
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an 
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been 
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations, 
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.
            <sup>[18]</sup> 
            Graphic design has been practiced in various forms throughout 
            history; in fact, good examples of graphic design date back to

            As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, 
            advances in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries, 
            with composers or typographers often designing pages according to 
            established type.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            By the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct 
            profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor 
            specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new 
            technologies and business possibilities brought about by the 
            Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation
            of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from 
            its actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early
            20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and 
            magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of 
            communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, creating
            an expression appropriate to the content. In 1922, typographer
            William A. Dwiggins coined the term graphic design to identify the 
            emerging field.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers 
            continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial 
            possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, and 
            graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, 
            book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, 
            signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, 
            and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become 
            a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread 
            worldwide.

            messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode
            and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message 
            as a construction of signs which through interaction with 
            receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

            and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and 
            modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the 
            selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between 
            all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific 
            characters) and leading (line spacing).

            Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, 
            graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the 
            digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts 
            communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942
            Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage 
            report.

            Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a 
            page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design 
            has always been a consideration in printed material and more 
            recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically 
            consist of

        <h2>Grids</h2>
        <p>
            A grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, 
            allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. 
            Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and 
            a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being 
            utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with 
            Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a 
            highly systematic approach to visualizing information. However, 
            grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning 
            the label of "designersaur." Today, grids are once again considered 
            crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or 
            veterans.
