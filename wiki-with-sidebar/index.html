                    play certain dungeons alone, supported by 
                    computer-controlled party members. Some dungeons are for 
                    lower-leveled players to gain EXP quickly while others are 
                    for experienced players to collect rare items, equipment,

                    The Duty Roulette system randomly assigns the player to an 
                    accessible dungeon, and once per day, awards additional 
                    bonus EXP scaled to character level on completion.
                    <sup>[9]</sup> FATEs permit large groups of players, 
                    whether or not they are in a party, to participate in a 
                    shared task in the world. These location-specific events 
                    include battles with notorious monsters, defending 
                    locations, escorting non-player characters, culling 
                    wildlife, and assaulting enemy fortresses, among other 
                    types.
                    <sup>[8]</sup> 
                    Finally, each enemy the player kills provides EXP, with 
                    further EXP available from the Hunting Log, for killing a 
                    fixed amount of specific creatures. At maximum level, 
                    character progression focuses entirely on acquring stronger 
                    equipment, raising the character's "item level". This 
                    equipment can be gained through a variety of sources 
                    including endgame dungeons, crafting, raids, primal

                    arena featuring structured four-versus-four battles where a 
                    player could register with up to three teammates to 
                    challenge another four-person team. This mode was removed 
                    in patch 6.1, when it was replaced with Crystalline 
                    Conflict,
                    <sup>[11]</sup> 
                    which consists of two teams of five competing to seize 
                    control of and push a crystal which starts at the middle of 
                    the arena to each team's goal point. The second type, 
                    Frontlines, is a large battleground in which players form 
                    teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are delineated by 
                    players' allegiance to one of three Grand Companies and the 
                    team which reaches the target number of points first wins 
                    the match. Multiple modes are available, each with 
                    differing locations and rulesets. Within the game, 
                    Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military 
                    exercises between the three nations with the ulterior 
                    goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical
                     artifacts.
                     <sup>[12]</sup> 
                     The third type, Rival Wings, is a battle arena mode where 
                     players manipulate minion waves and pilot mechs to destroy 
                     enemy objectives.

                    Final Fantasy XIV is set on Hydaelyn, a fictional world of 
                    diverse environments across multiple continents, focused 
                    on the region of Eorzea.

                    theocracy in snowy, mountainous Coerthas. A land bridge 
                    links Eorzea to two other continents to the east, which 
                    have largely been conquered by the Garlean Empire. Other 
                    societies include indigenous tribes, such as Sylphs and 
                    Kobolds; Sharlayan, a scholarly city; and Ala Mhigo
                    in eastern Eorzea, annexed twenty years prior by the 
                    Garlean Empire.
                    <sup>[23]</sup> 
                    Facing Garlean invasion, Ishgard withdrew from the Eorzean
                    Alliance, leaving it defunct. The once-vibrant Mor Dhona 
                    region was devastated during the previous Garlean 
                    campaign.

                    Eorzean history is divided into prosperous "Astral" eras, 
                    and disastrous "Umbral" eras caused by great Calamities.
                    <sup>[25]</sup> 
                    The First Umbral Era marked the end of the age of gods.
                    <sup>[26]</sup> 
                    The Twelve, guardian deities of Eorzea, retreated from 
                    direct mortal contact. As society recovers from Umbral 
                    eras, new Astral eras begin. Under the hegemonic Allagan 
                    Empire of the Third Astral era, technological development 
                    reached its zenith, including aerospace construction. As 
                    each Calamity was linked to one of the six fundamental 
                    elements—air, lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water—the 
                    Sixth Astral Era was expected to last forever, but five 
                    years ago, the Garlean Empire triggered the Seventh Umbral 
                    Calamity.

                    the moon, exterminating all opposition.

                    The Alliance reunited in response, reviving their Grand 
                    Company militaries. Adventurers defeated van Darnus but 
                    could not stop Dalamud's descent. At the Battle of 
                    Carteneau Flats in Mor Dhona, Dalamud revealed itself as an 
                    ancient Allagan prison for the primal dragon Bahamut; his 
                    escape triggered the Seventh Umbral Calamity.
                    <sup>[28]</sup> 
                    Louisoix Leveilleur called upon the Twelve to imprison 
                    Bahamut, but failed; before he sacrificed himself to defeat 
                    Bahamut, he sent the adventurers "beyond the reach of time" 
                    for when they were needed again.[29] Meanwhile, the Empire 
                    became paralyzed by a succession crisis as the elderly 
                    Emperor Solus fell ill.
