                This is a portrait of me in middle school. In the middle school
                I went to Bullying was a common thing there. it was so bad that
                I wanted to stay home, because I knew what awaited there. The 
                worst part is when the teachers did help. They just look at me 
                and tell me to toughen up, or it's just words. But what they 
                didn't know it was more than just words. They would pull out my
                hair, push me down the stair where I almost broke my arm.
                It was a life of hell! No one would help me, they just sat
                there and watch. Once I left that school I thought I was free
                but God was I wrong. High-school didn't treat me any better
                I thought I would have to worry about the students. But it
                was the teachers that I had to worry about too.
            </p>

            <p>
                They would tell me "I wasn't enough" and that "I wouldn't go 
                far with that silly art dream of yours". But I didn't let that 
                get me down thank too middle school. I toughen up a lot and use
                their words for encouragement. I turned it around against them
                and started to work harder befor. Even tho the bullying didn't 
                stop I still pushed more and went farther than befor. I made 
                poster to show how far I gotten. And what great things I doing 
                now. This poster proves to me that even tho I got kick down so 
                many time. To never give up and that I can go far if I put my 
                mind to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the people out there that is suffer from bullying. Please 
                don't give up you have achived so much to give up now. Even tho
                you think that nobody cares. There's always someone there for 
                you. That loves you and think you're important and if you 
                haven't known this already. You're meant for greatness 
                nobody can be the better you. Only can push far, yes it's gonna
                hard but since when is it gonna easy. We can't acheve anything
                without working for it firt, but that dosen't mean to give up.
                It means you are where you at and that you're doing great.
