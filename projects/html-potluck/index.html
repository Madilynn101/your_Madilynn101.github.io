        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the Vanilla Butter Cake</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>

            <li>2 1/2 tsp tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the cheesecake batter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eight ounce packages ounces cream cheese, (3 cups)</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 cup whipping cream, (35% cream, un-whipped)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the strawberry filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 tsp unflavoured gelatin powder, stirred into 1/4 cup 
                cold water
            </li>
            <li>5 cups sliced strawberries, Divided in 2 halves</li>
            <li>
                3/4 cup sugar, use up to 1 1/4 cups if you prefer it sweeter
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp corn starch, dissolved in 1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Vanilla Whipped Cream</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 tbsp icing sugar, powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>To prepare the Vanilla Butter Cake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Grease and flour a 9 inch springform pan. Line the bottom with 
                parchment paper for easier release from the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cream together the butter and sugar very well until light and 
                fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition 
                until light and fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Sift together the cake flour and baking powder.</li>
            <li>
                Fold dry ingredients into the creamed mixture alternately with 
                the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake at 325 degrees F for about 35 - 40 minutes. Rely on the 
                toothpick test to ensure that it is properly baked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then release the 
                cake from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack until 
                completely cooled
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To prepare the cheesecake batter</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Line the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan with a layer or two 
                of parchment paper. I like to lay the squares of parchment 
                paper over the bottom section, then clip on the side section 
                and trim the excess paper from the bottom. This helps keep 
                the pan from leaking. out a little of the batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap the outside of the pan with a couple of layers of 
                aluminum foil. This buffers the heat and allows for slow even 
                baking and a more creamy cheesecake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cream together the cream cheese and sugar for 2 to 3 minutes 
                until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
            </li>
            <li>Beat in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>
                Finally blend in the whipping cream well until the batter is 
                very smooth. Using a rubber bowl scraper/spatula, scrape the 
                bottom and the sides of the bowl as well as the electric 
                beaters/paddle and give the batter a final beating for 1 
                minute on a higher speed. This final step ensures that there 
                are no lumps in the batter and introduces a little air into the 
                cheesecake to make it lighter.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Baking the cheesecake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour into the prepared pan and bake  at 300 degrees F for 
                60-70 minutes. (Oven temperatures will vary slightly. Mine 
                takes the full 70 minutes and you can go to 75 if you feel you 
                need to.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't be an compulsive oven door opener! Don't open it at all 
                in the first hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cheesecake does not have to brown at all in order to be 
                fully baked; the surface of the cheesecake should lose any 
                shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly 
                wobbly just at the centre at this point.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely 
                around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake 
                to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room 
                temperature. (NOT in the fridge). Refrigerate after fully 
                cooled for several hours or overnight if possible.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To prepare the filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the gelatin to the 1/4 cup cold water and set aside for a 
                few minutes until needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 2 1/2 cups of the sliced strawberries, the sugar and 1/4 
                cup water to a small saucepan and simmer for only a few minutes
                 until the strawberries have release most of their juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dissolve the corn starch in the 1/4 cup of water and stir into 
                the simmering strawberries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir constantly for 2 to three minutes while the strawberry 
                mixture thickens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat and stir in the gelatine mixture until it is 
                fully dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow to cool to almost room temperature before stirring in the 
                2 cups of fresh sliced berries.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To prepare the Vanilla Whipped Cream</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Simply beat the whipping cream, icing sugar and vanilla extract 
                in the bowl of an electric mixer until firm peaks form.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To construct the cake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While the cheesecake layer is still in the pan, take the cake 
                base and place it evenly on top of the chilled cheesecake 
                layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the serving plate on top of the cake and invert the 
                entire thing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unclip the pan, remove the side section, then remove the bottom 
                section and carefully peel off the parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pipe a whipped cream border around the  top of the cheesecake. 
                ( this can be done with a large Ziploc bag with the  corner 
                snipped off if you don't have a piping bag.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon the strawberry filling into the middle of the whipped 
                cream border. Chill for another couple of hours to let the 
                filling set. Garnish with fresh cut strawberries.
            </li>
        </ol>
